## About Analytics
Analytics is an easy difficulty Linux machine with exposed HTTP and SSH services. Enumeration of the website reveals a `Metabase` instance, which is vulnerable to Pre-Authentication Remote Code Execution (`[CVE-2023-38646](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38646)`), which is leveraged to gain a foothold inside a Docker container. Enumerating the Docker container we see that the environment variables set contain credentials that can be used to SSH into the host. Post-exploitation enumeration reveals that the kernel version that is running on the host is vulnerable to `GameOverlay`, which is leveraged to obtain root privileges.
